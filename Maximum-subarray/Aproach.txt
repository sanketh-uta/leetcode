Here the approach is 
consider 2 variables total = 0 and res = first array element.

iterate over the loop and everytime compare when the total < 0 if yes then make total = 0 because if its negative and if you add 
the current array element then the sum will always less than the number considered itself.

then add the current index element to total
compare if the total > res if yes then res = total

Finally the res will have the max sum of the subarray
