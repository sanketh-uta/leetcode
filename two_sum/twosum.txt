1) If asked to find the 2 indices whose sum will be equal to given target and given only 1 solution is definetely possible and elements not sorted
    we have to use HashMap
        1) assume that at each iteration one element is that element and calculate complement = target - that element
        2) see in hashmap if complement exists
            is exists then bring that index using m.get(complement) and we already know indes of that element(i) so return 
            if does not exist add that element to the map and also its index;


2)twosum if given elements are sorted
    we can use 2 pointer approach 
    1) assign left to index 0;
    2) assign right to index last;
    3) while left < right calculate the sum a[left] and a[right]
    4) if sum < target --> left++
    5) if sum > target --> right--
    6) if sum == target ---> indices found so return new int[]{left,right}
