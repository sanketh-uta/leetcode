We have to rotate the array right k no of times.

Intution --> Swap the elements from length-k to end  with the indexes 0 to k-1
            But now after swapping the elements in the starting part of array will be expected but the elements from nums[k]
            will be not exactly the way we want i.e, they will not be rotated.

Appraoch --> To rotate the for larger k we can do k % nums.lenhgth as rotating the array of length k with k times will be same as original array

    Then we reverse the entire array from index 0 to length-1; by swapping the numbers [1,2,3,4] --> becomes [4,3,2,1];
    reverse the first part of array from index 0 to k-1
    reverse the rest of the array from k to length-1
